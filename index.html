    <p>How to play: </p>
    <p>
    A pattern of 5 boxes will appear. Wait for the pattern to finish, and then repeat the pattern by clicking the location of where the boxes appeared in order of when they appeared.
    <br/>Every 3 levels the grid will increase in size, every 5 levels the rate of appearance and rate of dissapearance will increase, and every 20 levels, another box is added to the pattern.
    <br/>You will receive 1 point for every correct repetition. The game will end when you get one incorrect.
